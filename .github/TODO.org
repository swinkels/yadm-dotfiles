- [ ] use other method to add README

Currently directory ~.github~ contains the README so

1. yadm doesn't copy the README to the root of your home directory and
2. GitHub still shows it to people that visit the main page of the repo on
   GitHub.

Unfortunately, yadm still creates a directory ~.github~ in the root of the repo.

describes another approach using a sparse Git checkout. With this approach, you
can even do without the ~.github~ directory.

- [ ] describe use of standard Git porcelains with a bare repo
- [ ] describe use of ~.bash_profile~ and ~.bashrc~ for ~msys2~
- [ ] describe altenate files in use, so ~default~, ~msys2~ and ~Nunhems~
